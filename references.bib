Our proof includes the following essential steps: 1. We simultaneously strengthen a conjecture by the first two authors and Toda, and prove that it follows from a more natural and seemingly weaker statement. This conjecture is a Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequality involving the third Chern character of "tilt-stable" two-term complexes on smooth projective threefolds; we extend it from complexes of tilt-slope zero to arbitrary tilt-slope. 2. We show that this stronger conjecture implies the so-called support property of Bridgeland stability conditions, and the existence of an explicit open subset of the space of stability conditions. 3. We prove our conjecture for abelian threefolds, thereby giving reproving and generalizing a result by Maciocia and Piyaratne. Important in our approach is a more systematic understanding on the behaviour of quadratic inequalities for semistable objects under wall-crossing, closely related to the support property.},

After setting up the necessary definitions I prove a deformation result which shows that the space \${\textbackslash}Stab({\textbackslash}T)\$ with its natural topology is a manifold, possibly infinite-dimensional.},

In this paper, we focus on one particular way in which mathematical physics has guided the development of algebraic geometry in the past 40+ years. To be precise, we examine how the notion of mathematical instanton bundles in algebraic geometry has evolved from a class of vector bundles over the complex projective 3-space both to a class of torsion free sheaves on projective varieties of arbitrary dimension, and to a class of objects in the derived category of Fano threefolds. The original results contained in this survey focus precisely on the latter direction; in particular, we prove that the classical rank 2 instanton bundles over the projective 3-space are indeed instanton objects for any suitable chamber in the space of Bridgeland stability conditions.},

  abstract = {This book can form the basis of a second course in algebraic geometry. As motivation, it takes concrete questions from enumerative geometry and intersection theory, and provides intuition and technique, so that the student develops the ability to solve geometric problems. The authors explain key ideas, including rational equivalence, Chow rings, Schubert calculus and Chern classes, and readers will appreciate the abundant examples, many provided as exercises with solutions available online. Intersection is concerned with the enumeration of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. It has been an active area of mathematics since the work of Leibniz. Chasles' nineteenth-century calculation that there are 3264 smooth conic plane curves tangent to five given general conics was an important landmark, and was the inspiration behind the title of this book. Such computations were motivation for Poincar{\'e}'s development of topology, and for many subsequent theories, so that intersection theory is now a central topic of modern mathematics.},

We first construct a well-behaved irreducible component of their moduli spaces. Then, when the intermediate Jacobian of X is trivial, we look at the associated monads, hyperdeterminants and nets of quadrics. We also study one case where the intermediate Jacobian of X is non-trivial, namely when X is the intersection of two quadrics in P5, relating instanton bundles on X to vector bundles of higher rank on a the curve of genus 2 naturally associated with X.},

  abstract = {This book provides a systematic exposition of the theory of Fourier-Mukai transforms from an algebro-geometric point of view. Assuming a basic knowledge of algebraic geometry, the key aspect of this book is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety. The derived category is a subtle invariant of the isomorphism type of a variety, and its group of autoequivalences often shows a rich structure. As it turns out --- and this feature is pursued throughout the book --- the behaviour of the derived category is determined by the geometric properties of the canonical bundle of the variety. Including notions from other areas, e.g., singular cohomology, Hodge theory, abelian varieties, K3 surfaces; full proofs and exercises are provided. The final chapter summarizes recent research directions, such as connections to orbifolds and the representation theory of finite groups via the McKay correspondence, stability conditions on triangulated categories, and the notion of the derived category of sheaves twisted by a gerbe.},

Next, we prove that walls within a certain region of the upper half plane that parametrizes geometric stability conditions must always intersect the curve given by the vanishing of the slope function and, for a fixed value of s, have a maximum turning point there. We then use all of these facts to prove that Gieseker semistability is equivalent to asymptotic semistability along a class of paths in the upper half plane, and to show how to find large families of walls. We illustrate how to compute all of the walls and describe the Bridgeland moduli spaces for the Chern character (2,0,-1,0) on complex projective 3-space in a suitable region of the upper half plane.},

Employing the previous framework by Bayer, Bertram, Macr{\textbackslash}`i, Stellari and Toda, we construct an open subset of stability conditions on every smooth quintic threefold in \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{P\}{\textasciicircum}4\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb C\}\$.},

This book is the first in-depth treatment of this important part (or component) of homological algebra. It carefully explains the foundations in detail before moving on to key applications in commutative and noncommutative algebra, many otherwise unavailable outside of research articles. These include commutative and noncommutative dualizing complexes, perfect DG modules, and tilting DG bimodules. Written with graduate students in mind, the emphasis here is on explicit constructions (with many examples and exercises) as opposed to axiomatics, with the goal of demystifying this difficult subject. Beyond serving as a thorough introduction for students, it will serve as an important reference for researchers in algebra, geometry and mathematical physics"--},
