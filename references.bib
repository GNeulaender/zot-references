This conjecture is a Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequality involving the third Chern character of "tilt-stable" two-term complexes on smooth projective threefolds; we extend it from complexes of tilt-slope zero to arbitrary tilt-slope. 2. We show that this stronger conjecture implies the so-called support property of Bridgeland stability conditions, and the existence of an explicit open subset of the space of stability conditions. 3. We prove our conjecture for abelian threefolds, thereby giving reproving and generalizing a result by Maciocia and Piyaratne. Important in our approach is a more systematic understanding on the behaviour of quadratic inequalities for semistable objects under wall-crossing, closely related to the support property.},

Our notion includes openness of stability, semistable reduction, a support property uniformly across the family, and boundedness of semistable objects. We show that such a structure exists whenever stability conditions are known to exist on the fibers.             Our main application is the generalization of Mukai's theory for moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on K3 surfaces to moduli spaces of Bridgeland semistable objects in the Kuznetsov component associated to a cubic fourfold. This leads to the extension of theorems by Addington--Thomas and Huybrechts on the derived category of special cubic fourfolds, to a new proof of the integral Hodge conjecture, and to the construction of an infinite series of unirational locally complete families of polarized hyperk\"ahler manifolds of K3 type.             Other applications include the deformation-invariance of Donaldson--Thomas invariants counting Bridgeland stable objects on Calabi--Yau threefolds, and a method for constructing stability conditions on threefolds via degeneration.},

We then apply to the latter a deformation theory for morphisms with a fixed lift of the target, which is developed in the appendix. Using this as a key ingredient we introduce a moduli space which classifies semiorthogonal decompositions of the category of perfect complexes of a smooth projective family. Using Artin's criterion, we show that this is an \textbackslash 'etale algebraic space over the base scheme of the family, which can be non-quasicompact and non-separated. We generalise this to families of geometric noncommutative schemes in the sense of Orlov. We also define a subfunctor classifying nontrivial semiorthogonal decompositions only, and conjecture it is an open and closed subspace.},

After setting up the necessary definitions I prove a deformation result which shows that the space \$\textbackslash Stab(\textbackslash T)\$ with its natural topology is a manifold, possibly infinite-dimensional.},

In this paper, we focus on one particular way in which mathematical physics has guided the development of algebraic geometry in the past 40+ years. To be precise, we examine how the notion of mathematical instanton bundles in algebraic geometry has evolved from a class of vector bundles over the complex projective 3-space both to a class of torsion free sheaves on projective varieties of arbitrary dimension, and to a class of objects in the derived category of Fano threefolds. The original results contained in this survey focus precisely on the latter direction; in particular, we prove that the classical rank 2 instanton bundles over the projective 3-space are indeed instanton objects for any suitable chamber in the space of Bridgeland stability conditions.},

  abstract = {This book can form the basis of a second course in algebraic geometry. As motivation, it takes concrete questions from enumerative geometry and intersection theory, and provides intuition and technique, so that the student develops the ability to solve geometric problems. The authors explain key ideas, including rational equivalence, Chow rings, Schubert calculus and Chern classes, and readers will appreciate the abundant examples, many provided as exercises with solutions available online. Intersection is concerned with the enumeration of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. It has been an active area of mathematics since the work of Leibniz. Chasles' nineteenth-century calculation that there are 3264 smooth conic plane curves tangent to five given general conics was an important landmark, and was the inspiration behind the title of this book. Such computations were motivation for Poincar\'e's development of topology, and for many subsequent theories, so that intersection theory is now a central topic of modern mathematics.},

As a main application, we show that curves on elliptic K3 surfaces serve as the first known examples of smooth k-gonal curves which are general from the viewpoint of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. In particular, we provide new proofs of the main non-existence and existence results in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. Finally, using degree-k Halphen surfaces, we construct explicit examples of curves defined over number fields which are general from the perspective of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory.},

In particular, when \$g\textbackslash geq r\textasciicircum 2\textbackslash geq 4\$, the rank \$r\$ Clifford index of \$C\$ can be computed by the restriction of Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles on \$X\$ corresponding to line bundles on the curve \$C\$.

We also apply the same method to the projective plane and show that the rank \$r\$ Clifford index of a degree \$d(\textbackslash geq 5)\$ smooth plane curve is \$d-4\$, which is the same as the Clifford index of the curve.},

Assuming a basic knowledge of algebraic geometry, the key aspect of this book is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety. The derived category is a subtle invariant of the isomorphism type of a variety, and its group of autoequivalences often shows a rich structure. As it turns out --- and this feature is pursued throughout the book --- the behaviour of the derived category is determined by the geometric properties of the canonical bundle of the variety. Including notions from other areas, e.g., singular cohomology, Hodge theory, abelian varieties, K3 surfaces; full proofs and exercises are provided. The final chapter summarizes recent research directions, such as connections to orbifolds and the representation theory of finite groups via the McKay correspondence, stability conditions on triangulated categories, and the notion of the derived category of sheaves twisted by a gerbe.},

Next, we prove that walls within a certain region of the upper half plane that parametrizes geometric stability conditions must always intersect the curve given by the vanishing of the slope function and, for a fixed value of s, have a maximum turning point there. We then use all of these facts to prove that Gieseker semistability is equivalent to asymptotic semistability along a class of paths in the upper half plane, and to show how to find large families of walls. We illustrate how to compute all of the walls and describe the Bridgeland moduli spaces for the Chern character (2,0,-1,0) on complex projective 3-space in a suitable region of the upper half plane.},

As an application by using algebraically moving techniques, we prove that the bounded derived category of the \$i\$-th symmetric product of a smooth projective curve \$C\$ has no nontrivial semi-orthogonal decompositions when the genus \$g(C)\textbackslash geq 2\$ and \$i\textbackslash leq g(C)-1\$. We prove indecomposability of derived categories of some examples of elliptic surfaces with \$P\_\textbraceleft g\textbraceright (X)=0\$, and some natural examples of minimal surfaces of general type.

In particular, all stability conditions on smooth curves are classified and a connected component of the stability manifold containing all the geometric stability conditions is identified for singular curves. On smooth curves of positive genus, the set of all non-locally-finite stability conditions gives a partial boundary of any known compactification of the stability manifold. To provide the full boundary, a notion of weak stability condition is proposed based on the definition of Collins--Lo--Shi--Yau and is classified for smooth curves of positive genus. On singular curves, the connected component containing geometric stability conditions is shown to be preserved by the two natural actions on the stability manifold.},

  abstract = {We study the derived category of quiver representations for an acyclic quiver Q. This can be described very concretely because the abelian category of Qrepresentations is hereditary, and our first occupation is to do so. We then use reflection functors to construct explicit equivalences between the derived categories of quivers with the same underlying graph, but whose representation categories are distinct. Passing to the derived category thus makes the representation theory of quivers whose underlying graphs are acyclic entirely uniform under changes of orientation. Finally, we discuss the iterated weight filtration, which can be computed for any artinian lattice, given a weight function. This gives a refinement of the Harder--Narasimhan filtration coming from any stability condition on Db (Rep Q). The refinement depends only on a choice of positive weights at each vertex of Q, and is thus orientation-agnostic.},

We introduce modular t-stability (whose semistable subcategories can be separated on the level of K0) and give a complete description of finest and modular t-stabilities on a category generated by an exceptional pair. The description of semistable classes is quite parallel in this case to the geometric theory of continuous fractions. For categories generated by exceptional collections of higher length we construct a huge family of modular t-stabilities depending on a choice of irrational curve on appropriate Grassmannian.},

The first part of the thesis is concentrated in two chapters: the first one referring to a brief discussion on the theory of schemes, derived categories and Chern characters. The second one establishes the fundamental theory of Bridgeland stability necessary for the following chapters, with a brief discussion of exceptional collections towards its end. Next, we present the main results obtained during the Ph.D. The chapter on asymptotic stability shows results analogous to the ones obtained by Jardim--Maciocia, now for objects with zero Chern character equal to zero. The last chapter is concerned with the local behavior of Bridgeland stability, describing the quiver regions on the upper-half plane of stability conditions H and with that proving the stability of the instantons in these regions. The thesis has an appendix and annex that discuss some intermediate theoretical and computational results obtained during the search for examples of quiver regions and their uses.},

The concepts come alive with many examples and exercises. This short text covers the usual material taught in a year-long course.},

This book is the first in-depth treatment of this important part (or component) of homological algebra. It carefully explains the foundations in detail before moving on to key applications in commutative and noncommutative algebra, many otherwise unavailable outside of research articles. These include commutative and noncommutative dualizing complexes, perfect DG modules, and tilting DG bimodules. Written with graduate students in mind, the emphasis here is on explicit constructions (with many examples and exercises) as opposed to axiomatics, with the goal of demystifying this difficult subject. Beyond serving as a thorough introduction for students, it will serve as an important reference for researchers in algebra, geometry and mathematical physics"--},
